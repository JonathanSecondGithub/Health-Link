# Health-Link
A communication module for openmrs to help health care workers communicate effectively

# System Overview:
# Technical Overview
- OpenMRS is a framework built upon Java and other related frameworks. It is based on a modular architecture which consists of a core application and optional modules which provide additional functionality to the core workflows.
- The key architectural components of the OpenMRS core can be depicted as follows:

- The backbone of OpenMRS is the core API. This API has methods for all of the basic functions like adding/updating a patient, adding/updating a concept, etc. These methods are provided in services. There are classes named PatientService, ConceptService, EncounterService, ObsService, etc. The Data Model groups the database tables into "domains." Each domain is a separate colored box. The breakdown of domains/tables is essentially a visual representation of the service separation.

#Functionality
- Real-time Messaging:
        ◦ Ability for users to send and receive messages instantly, allowing for quick communication between healthcare providers.
- Notifications:
        ◦ System-generated notifications to alert users about new messages, updates to existing messages, or important events, ensuring timely responses and reducing the risk of missed communications.
- Message Archiving and Search:
        ◦ Archiving of messages for future reference and audit purposes, with robust search functionality to quickly retrieve past conversations or specific information.
- Attachment Support:
        ◦ Ability to attach files, images, or other relevant documents to messages, facilitating the sharing of information such as lab results, imaging reports, or care plans.
       Secure Communication:
        ◦ Implementation of encryption and other security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of patient information transmitted through the communication module, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.
- User Authentication and Authorization:
        ◦ Authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users accessing the communication module, with role-based access control to ensure that users only have access to information and features appropriate to their role and responsibilities.
- Message Tracking and Delivery Status:
        ◦ Tracking of message delivery status to monitor whether messages have been sent, delivered, or read by recipients, providing transparency and accountability in communication workflows.
- Customizable Templates and Responses:
        ◦ Creation of customizable message templates or predefined responses for common scenarios or inquiries, streamlining communication and ensuring consistency in messaging.
- Integration with External Systems:
        ◦ Integration with other healthcare IT systems, such as EHR, laboratory information systems (LIS), or radiology systems, to facilitate seamless exchange of information and streamline clinical workflows.
- Audit Trails and Compliance Reporting:
        ◦ Logging of all communication activities, including message exchanges, user interactions, and system events, to maintain an audit trail for compliance purposes and facilitate reporting on communication metrics.
